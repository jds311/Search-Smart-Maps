# Search-Smart-Maps
This project has been created as a practical application of the Data Structures and Algorithms course. In this Java application, the user can select the source and destination location and the app will highlight the shortest route on the map and also give the distance. We have used Java Swing to create the User Interface. For finding the shortest path, we have used Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Bellmanford's shortest path algorithm. We have also compared the efficiency of the two algorithms by comparing the response times of these algorithms. For storing the data, we have used phpMyAdmin MySQL database.
